User Story: Data Analytics with Azure
Title: Perform Data Analytics and Build Predictive Models Using Azure Machine Learning Studio

As a: Data Analyst or IT Professional,
I want to: analyze sample data and build predictive models using Azure Machine Learning Studio,
So that: I can gain insights, identify trends, and make data-driven predictions.

Acceptance Criteria:

Setup:
An Azure Machine Learning Workspace is successfully set up.

Data Upload:

- Employee Performance dataset (e.g., publicly available CSV file) is uploaded to Azure Machine Learning Studio.
- The data is preprocessed (if necessary) for analysis.

Data Exploration:

- Tools in Azure Machine Learning Studio are used to explore data, visualize trends, and detect patterns.
- Key metrics and insights are identified and documented.

Model Building:

- A simple predictive model (e.g., linear regression) is created using the drag-and-drop interface.
- The model is trained using a train-test split and achieves measurable accuracy.

Result Visualization:

- Findings and model performance are visualized using built-in tools.
- Insights are presented in a format suitable for stakeholders.

Documentation:
The process for data upload, exploration, model building, and result visualization is fully documented for reproducibility.
